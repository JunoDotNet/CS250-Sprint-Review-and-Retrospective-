How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs and implementing them into a program requires a clear idea of the user's vision. User stories, which are brief descriptions of features from the user's perspective, are crucial in this process. They help in understanding user requirements, allowing developers to prioritize tasks and create solutions that precisely meet user needs. By using user stories, developers can ensure that their program remains focused on delivering an ideal user experience.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Approaching program development involves a structured yet flexible method. I aim to incorporate agile processes like Scrum into my future work. There are several benefits to using Scrum as a development workflow. Some of these benefits are continuous feedback, iterative development, and responsiveness to changing requirements. In summary, following agile practices ensures collaboration, enhances communication and enables the creation of high-quality software that can evolve alongside user needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development includes clear communication, active participation, and a willingness to collaborate. It also involves adaptability and a readiness to assume diverse roles within the team. Showing respect for different perspectives and offering constructive feedback contribute to a positive team environment. A good team member combines technical skills with effective communication and a collaborative mindset, ensuring the successful delivery of high quality software products.
